# Keepalived Configuration for Pi2 (BACKUP) - Two-Pi HA Mode
# =============================================================
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Copy this file to your Pi2
# 2. Replace placeholder values with your actual configuration:
#    - <VRRP_PASSWORD>: Your VRRP authentication password (MUST match Pi1!)
#    - 192.168.8.251: Your Pi2 IP address (HOST_IP on Pi2)
#    - 192.168.8.250: Your Pi1 IP address
#    - 192.168.8.249: Your VIP address (same as Pi1)
#    - eth0: Your network interface
#
# 3. Mount this file into the keepalived container:
#    volumes:
#      - ./keepalived.pi2.conf:/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf:ro
#
# Or use environment variable substitution with envsubst before mounting.
