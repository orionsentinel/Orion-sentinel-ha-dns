                        Automatic Failover
```

**How It Works:**

1. **VIP (Virtual IP):** A single IP address that floats between Pi #1 and Pi #2
2. **Clients:** Configure DNS to point to the VIP only
3. **Keepalived:** Monitors health and manages VIP assignment
4. **Automatic Failover:** If the MASTER node fails, BACKUP takes over the VIP instantly
5. **Privacy:** All DNS queries go through local Unbound (no third-party DNS providers)

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi 4 or 5** (4GB+ RAM recommended)
- **32GB+ SD card or SSD** (SSD highly recommended for reliability)
- **Ethernet connection** (WiFi works but wired is better)
- **3A+ USB-C power supply**

- **Docker Compose v2** (auto-installed by bootstrap script)

### Network

- **Static IP addresses** for each Pi (configure in your router)
- **Available IP for VIP** (must not conflict with DHCP range)
- **Network access** for initial setup and package downloads

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Single-Pi Setup

For testing or when you only have one Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap the node
sudo ./scripts/bootstrap-node.sh --node=pi1 --ip=192.168.8.250

# 2. Edit .env configuration
cd /opt/orion-dns-ha
nano .env

# Set these REQUIRED variables:
#   - PIHOLE_PASSWORD (generate: openssl rand -base64 32)
#   - VRRP_PASSWORD (generate: openssl rand -base64 20)
#   - VIP_ADDRESS=192.168.8.249
#   - HOST_IP=192.168.8.250
#   - DEPLOYMENT_MODE=single-pi-ha

# 3. Validate and deploy
make validate-env
make up-core

# 4. Check status
make health-check
docker ps
```

### Two-Pi HA Setup

For production high-availability:

#### On Pi #1 (Primary/MASTER):

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap Pi1
sudo ./scripts/bootstrap-node.sh --node=pi1 --ip=192.168.8.250

# 2. Configure environment
cd /opt/orion-dns-ha
cp .env.production.example .env
nano .env

# Apply Pi1-specific settings from env/pi1.env.example:
#   HOST_IP=192.168.8.250
#   NODE_ROLE=MASTER
#   KEEPALIVED_PRIORITY=200
#   PEER_IP=192.168.8.251
#   VIP_ADDRESS=192.168.8.249

# Set REQUIRED passwords (use the SAME passwords on both Pis):
#   PIHOLE_PASSWORD=<generate with: openssl rand -base64 32>
#   VRRP_PASSWORD=<generate with: openssl rand -base64 20>

# 3. Deploy
make validate-env
make up-core
```

#### On Pi #2 (Secondary/BACKUP):

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap Pi2
sudo ./scripts/bootstrap-node.sh --node=pi2 --ip=192.168.8.251

# 2. Configure environment
cd /opt/orion-dns-ha
cp .env.production.example .env
nano .env

# Apply Pi2-specific settings from env/pi2.env.example:
#   HOST_IP=192.168.8.251
#   NODE_ROLE=BACKUP
#   KEEPALIVED_PRIORITY=150
#   PEER_IP=192.168.8.250
#   VIP_ADDRESS=192.168.8.249

# Set REQUIRED passwords (MUST MATCH Pi1):
#   PIHOLE_PASSWORD=<same as Pi1>
#   VRRP_PASSWORD=<same as Pi1>

# 3. Deploy
make validate-env
make up-core
```

#### Verify HA Setup:

```bash
# Check which Pi has the VIP
ip addr show | grep <VIP_ADDRESS>

# Test DNS resolution via VIP
dig @<VIP_ADDRESS> google.com

# Simulate failover (on MASTER node)
make down

# VIP should move to BACKUP node within seconds
# Verify from BACKUP node:
ip addr show | grep <VIP_ADDRESS>

# Bring MASTER back online
make up-core

# VIP should failback to MASTER
```

# On MASTER:
ip addr show | grep <VIP_ADDRESS>

# 2. Stop services on MASTER
make down

# 3. Verify VIP moved to BACKUP
# On BACKUP:
ip addr show | grep <VIP_ADDRESS>

# 4. Test DNS still works
dig @<VIP_ADDRESS> google.com

# 5. Bring MASTER back online
make up-core

# 6. Verify VIP returns to MASTER (may take up to 30 seconds)
ip addr show | grep <VIP_ADDRESS>
```

### Health Checks

Run comprehensive health checks:

```bash
# Quick check
make health-check

# Detailed check with verbose output
./scripts/check-dns.sh --verbose

# Check individual services
docker ps                           # Container status
docker logs pihole_primary          # Pi-hole logs
docker logs unbound_primary         # Unbound logs
docker logs keepalived              # Keepalived logs
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### DNS not resolving

```bash
# Check if services are running
docker ps

# Check health
make health-check

# Check Pi-hole logs
docker logs pihole_primary

# Check Unbound logs
docker logs unbound_primary

# Test DNS manually
dig @127.0.0.1 google.com
```

#### VIP not assigned

```bash
# Check keepalived status
docker logs keepalived

# Verify keepalived is running
docker ps | grep keepalived

# Check network interface
ip addr show <NETWORK_INTERFACE>

# Verify VRRP password matches on both Pis
grep VRRP_PASSWORD .env
```

#### Services won't start

```bash
# Check Docker
docker ps
systemctl status docker

# Check environment
make validate-env

# Check for port conflicts
netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':(53|80|5335|9100|9617|9167)'

# Check logs
docker compose logs
```

## 🔐 Privacy Policy

**This project ONLY supports Unbound (local recursive resolver) as the upstream DNS provider.**

✅ **What we use:**
- Unbound - Full recursive DNS resolver
- Queries go directly to authoritative servers
- No third-party can log your DNS queries

❌ **What we DON'T use:**
- Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
- Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)
- OpenDNS, Quad9, or any public DNS provider

**Why?** Using Unbound means maximum privacy. Your DNS queries are resolved directly from root servers without any third-party intermediary that could log, track, or monetize your browsing history.

See [docs/PIHOLE_CONFIGURATION.md](docs/PIHOLE_CONFIGURATION.md) for full rationale.
