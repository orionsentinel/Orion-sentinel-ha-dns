## [Unreleased]

### Added - v2.5.0 HA Reliability Improvements (2024-12-19) 🔒

- **Strict Keepalived Validation** - Prevent split-brain scenarios
  - Enforces VRRP_PASSWORD to be exactly 8 characters (VRRP PASS auth limitation)
  - Validates PEER_IP and UNICAST_SRC_IP when unicast mode is enabled
  - IPv4 address format validation with octet range checking
  - Clear error messages on validation failures with examples
  - Automatic script permission fixing on every container start (root:root, 700)
- **Enhanced Environment Templates** (`env/primary.env`, `env/secondary.env`)
  - Pre-configured templates with correct IPs for standard two-node setup
  - Primary: MASTER, priority 200, IPs 192.168.8.250→251
  - Secondary: BACKUP, priority 150, IPs 192.168.8.251→250
  - VIP_NETMASK default changed from /24 to /32 for cleaner host-only assignment
- **HA Verification Script** (`scripts/verify-ha.sh`)
  - Check which node currently holds the VIP
  - Display keepalived state (MASTER/BACKUP) from logs
  - Verify unicast peer configuration (PEER_IP, UNICAST_SRC_IP)
  - Test DNS resolution via VIP and node IPs
  - Color-coded output for easy status interpretation
- **Optional Pi-hole Configuration Sync** - Gravity Sync style replication
  - `scripts/pihole-sync.sh` - SSH-based primary→secondary sync
  - Syncs adlists, whitelist, blacklist, regex filters, custom DNS records
  - Optional gravity database sync
  - Dry-run mode for preview
  - systemd timer for automated sync every 6 hours
- **Comprehensive Troubleshooting Documentation**
  - How to diagnose secondary becoming MASTER when primary is healthy
  - VRRP packet verification with tcpdump
  - Unicast peer configuration verification commands
  - NIC flapping troubleshooting guidance
  - Script permission fix procedures

### Changed

- **Keepalived Container** - Added NET_RAW capability for VRRP protocol 112
- **Default VIP Netmask** - Changed from /24 to /32 for host-only VIP assignment
- **Documentation** - VRRP_PASSWORD requirements now prominently documented in README and MULTI_NODE_QUICKSTART

### Fixed

- **Split-brain prevention** - Secondary no longer becomes MASTER when primary is healthy
  - Root cause: Empty PEER_IP or wrong unicast configuration
  - Fix: Strict validation prevents container start with invalid config
- **Script permission warnings** - "Unsafe permissions ... disabling" errors
  - Root cause: /etc/keepalived is a bind mount, permissions not preserved
  - Fix: Scripts copied and secured on every container start
- **Configuration clarity** - unicast_peer block now always included when USE_UNICAST_VRRP=true

### Security

- Added note about SSH root user in pihole-sync.sh (consider dedicated service account)
- Improved trap handling in sync scripts for proper cleanup

### Impact on Users

- **Deterministic HA Behavior**: Secondary stays BACKUP when primary is healthy
- **Easier Troubleshooting**: verify-ha.sh provides instant status overview
- **Safer Configuration**: Invalid settings caught at container start, not runtime
- **Optional Config Sync**: Pi-hole settings can be kept in sync automatically

### Migration Steps

Existing deployments continue to work, but to benefit from improvements:

1. **Update VRRP_PASSWORD to exactly 8 characters** (if not already):
   ```bash
   # In your .env file
   VRRP_PASSWORD=oriondns  # Exactly 8 chars
   ```

2. **Verify and set unicast peer IPs** (if using unicast mode):
   ```bash
   # Primary .env
   UNICAST_SRC_IP=192.168.8.250
   PEER_IP=192.168.8.251
   
   # Secondary .env
   UNICAST_SRC_IP=192.168.8.251
   PEER_IP=192.168.8.250
   ```

3. **Recreate keepalived containers**:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/orion-dns-ha/Orion-sentinel-ha-dns
   docker compose --profile two-node-ha-primary up -d --build --force-recreate keepalived
   ```

4. **Verify HA is working correctly**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify-ha.sh
   ```

Alternatively, use the new simplified templates:
```bash
# Primary node
cp env/primary.env .env
# Edit WEBPASSWORD and other settings

# Secondary node  
cp env/secondary.env .env
# Edit WEBPASSWORD and other settings
```

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/smart-upgrade.sh scripts/check-updates.sh scripts/secure-upgrade.sh

# Try interactive mode
bash scripts/smart-upgrade.sh -i

# Or check for updates
